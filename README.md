# Flutter Cursor Rules

A comprehensive `.cursorrules` file for Flutter/Dart development with Cursor AI IDE.

## Purpose

This repository provides coding guidelines and best practices for Flutter development that work seamlessly with Cursor AI. The rules ensure consistent, performant, and maintainable code generation.

## What's Included

### Dart General Guidelines

- **Basic Principles**: Type safety, English documentation, clean code structure
- **Nomenclature**: Consistent naming conventions (PascalCase, camelCase, underscores_case)
- **Functions**: Short, single-purpose functions with descriptive names
- **Data**: Immutability and composite types over primitives
- **Classes**: SOLID principles and composition over inheritance
- **Exceptions**: Strategic error handling patterns
- **Testing**: Arrange-Act-Assert with clear naming conventions

### Flutter-Specific Guidelines

- **State Management**: Riverpod patterns and controller architecture
- **Widget Architecture**: Flat widget trees for better performance
- **Theme Usage**: Proper theme colors for light/dark mode support
- **Layout**: Modern Flutter layout techniques
- **Performance**: Const constructors and efficient rebuilds
- **Testing**: Widget and integration testing standards

### Git Commit Message Guidelines

- **Conventional Commits**: Standardized commit message format
- **Commit Types**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- **Examples**: Ready-to-use commit message templates

## Usage

1. Copy the `.cursorrules` file to your Flutter project root
2. Open your project in Cursor IDE
3. The AI will automatically follow these guidelines
